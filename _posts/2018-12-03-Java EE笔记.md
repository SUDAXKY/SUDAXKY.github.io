# 1. Java EE Overview

## 2018.12.5

## 1. Enterprise application

Need for distributed, transactional, portable applications

Enterprise application provides the **business logic** for an enterprise.

1. They are always centrally managed and often interact with other enterprise software.
2. In the world of information technology, Enterprise Application must be **designed, built and produced** for **less money, with greater speed and with fewer resources**.



## 2. Programming Model

A simplified programming model

1. more <u>annotations</u> and less XML configuration.
2. <u>Dependency injection</u> can be applied to all resources needed by a component, effectively <u>hiding the creation and lookup of resources</u> from application code.



## 3. Java EE Application Model

1. The Java EE application model begins with the java programming language and JVM

2. The proven portability, security and developer productivity they provided forms the basis of the application model.

3. The Java EE application model defines an **architecture** for implementing services as **multitier applications** that deliver scalability, accessibility and manageability needed by enterprise-level application.

   The model partitions the work needed to implement a multitier service into the 	following parts

   1. The business and presentation logic to be implemented by the developer
   2. the standard system services provided by the Java EE platform.

4. The Java EE platform uses a **distributed** multitiered application model for enterprise applications. 
5. Application logic is divided into components according to function, and the **application components** that make up a Java EE application are **installed on various machines**, depending on the **tier** in the multitiered **Java EE environment** to which the application component belongs.



## 4. Multitiered Application 

1. Client-tier components run on the client machine
2. Web-tier components run on the Java EE server
3. Business-tier components run on Java EE server
4. Enterprise information system(EIS)-tier software runs on the EIS server

> 一般,J2EE应用程序被认为是三层体系结构的,因为它们主要分布在三个地方. 客户端,服务器端,数据库或者是后台的遗留层.





## 5. Security

1. The Java EE constraints to be defined at **deployment time**
2. The Java EE platform provides **standard declarative access control rules** that are defined by developer and interpreted when deploying.
3. Provide standard login mechanism -- No need to implement mechanisms like RBAC
4. The same application works in a variety of security environments without changing the source code.

## 6. Components

> A Java EE component is a self-contained functional software unit that is assembled into a Java EE application with its related classed and files that communicates with other components.

### 1. Defined Components

1. J2EE Clients

   Web Client；Applets；Application Client；Java Bean组件(the Java bean Component Architecture)

2. Web Components

   Servlet；Web Page（JSP）

3. Business Components

   EJB(enterprise beans) are components run on the server

### 2. Clients

两类客户端的区别：

1. Web client：
   1. 动态Web页面包含各种类型的动态语言
   2. Web客户端有时被称 -- 瘦客户机
   3. 从网络层接受到的网页可以包含一个嵌入式程序
2. Application client
   1. 为用户提供了处理需要一个功能比标记语言更丰富的用户界面任务的方法
   2. 通常有一个由Swing或AWT API实现的图形用户界面
   3. 应用程序客户端直接访问运行在业务层的企业Bean

### 3. JavaBeans Component

1. The JavaBeans Component Architecture
   1. The server and client tiers might also include components **based on the JavaBeans component architecture** (JavaBeans components) to **manage the data flow between an application client or applet and components** running on the Java EE server, or between server components and a database.
   2. JavaBeans components are **not considered Java EE components** by the Java EE specification.

### 4. Web Component

1. Java EE web components are either servlets or web pages created using Java Server Faces technology and/or JSP technology (JSP pages).
2. **might include a JavaBeans** component to manage the user input and send that input to enterprise beans running in the business tier for processing

### 5. Business Components

1. Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components (enterprise beans) are business components that run on the server.
2. Business code, which is logic that solves or meets the needs of a particular business domain such as banking, retail, or finance, is handled by enterprise beans running in either the business tier or the web tier.



### 6. EIS

The enterprise information system tier handles EIS software and includes enterprise infrastructure systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), mainframe transaction processing, database systems, and other legacy information systems.

## 7. Java EE Container

> Containers are the interface between a component and the low-level platform-specific functionality that supports the component.



### 1. Container Services

Before it can be executed , a web, enterprise, or application client component must be assembled into **a Java EE module** and **deployed into** its **container**.

The assembly process involves **specifying container settings** for each component in the Java EE application and for the Java EE application itself. Container settings customize the **underlying support** provided by the Java EE server, including services such as **security**, **transaction management**, **Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups**, and **remote connectivity**.



#### 1. Configurable Services

1. **J2EE安全模型**让你配置Web组件或者企业Bean以使系统资源只被授权用户访问
2. **J2EE事务模型**让你指定属于同一个事务的多个方法以使这些方法作为一个原子操作被执行
3. **JNDI查找服务**为企业应用中的多种命名和目录服务提供统一接口使应用程序组件可以统一访问这些命名和目录服务。
4. **J2EE远程连接模型**管理客户端和企业Bean之间的底层通信。企业Bean被创建后，客户端调用它的方法就像在本地虚拟机中的调用一样。

#### 2. Nonconfigurable Services

容器也管理着很多不可配置的服务，如**企业Bean**和**Servlet的生命周期**，**数据库连接池**，**数据持久化机制**和**J2EE平台API的访问权**等等。

### 2. Container Types

> Java EE server: The runtime portion of a Java EE product. A Java EE server provides EJB and web containers.

1. EJB container : 管理Java EE程序的执行
2. Web container: 管理网页，servlet和部分EJB程序的执行
3. Application Client container: 管理客户端组件应用的执行
4. Applets container: 管理Applets 的执行
